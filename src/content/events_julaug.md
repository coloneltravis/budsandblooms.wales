I have just posted all the sessions of Buds and Blooms for July and August. There will be three weeks of sessions before the end of term and then three weeks in the Summer holidays.

On a Wednesday there will be lots of new resources to explore and experiment with inside and I’m hoping to get a different children’s author to a attend every week to read their story.

On a Thursday, weather permitting we will be outside with lots of new outdoor equipment to explore and experiment with. If the weather is not suitable we will be indoors, still with lots of new equipment to have fun with.

Each session will also include singing, signing, stories and puppets, parachute games, instruments, and lots of props.

You are welcome to join both on a Wednesday and Thursday, the singing and parachute games will be the same at both sessions but the resources for free play will be different

Book now to avoid disappointment as spaces will be limited to ten families per session. School aged siblings are welcome, just let me know how many will be attending before you book your place. Everyone who books onto three or more Summer holiday sessions in advance will receive a free gift.

Buds and Blooms are small, friendly groups held in care homes in Barry on a Wednesday morning and Thursday afternoon. The residents love seeing us and interacting with the children and it is lovely to see the relationships that are forming between the residents, children and parents/carers.

Sessions cost £2.50 for the first child and £1.25 for each additional sibling or the equivalent of £2 a session for the first child and £1.00 for each additional sibling if paid for in a block of a full month at a time. Sessions need to be booked and paid for in advance as places are limited due to the nature of the sessions. New members always welcome.

Places are not refundable or transferable except in the unlikely event of me needing to cancel a session.
