Buds and Blooms are small, friendly not-for-profit groups held in care homes in the Vale of Glamorgan. We have one session in Rondel House day service on Maes Y Cwm Street in Barry on a Wednesday morning from 10.15-11.15 and Thursday afternoon in Morel Court care home on Raisdale Road in Penarth from 1.45-2.45.

Like and share our page to keep up to date with everything and help spread the word. When we reach 100 likes, everyone who has liked the page and shared this post will be entered into a draw to receive a free session of Buds and Blooms (this can be passed on to someone of your choice if it’s not applicable to you).

The residents love seeing us and interacting with the children and it is lovely to see the relationships that are forming between the residents, children and parents/carers. Each session includes sensory play, signing, singing with props and puppets, stories, parachute games and story massage.

Sessions cost £3.50 for the first child and £1.50 for each additional sibling or the equivalent of £3 a session for the first child and £1.25 for each additional sibling if paid for in a block of a full month at a time. Sessions need to be booked and paid for in advance as places are limited due to the nature of the sessions. New members always welcome.

If you would like to book a session please contact me regarding payment which ideally needs to be made via bank transfer. Once payment has been made, sign up to the event via the Parents and Tots Corner Facebook page for now.

Places are not refundable or transferable except in the unlikely event of me needing to cancel a session.
