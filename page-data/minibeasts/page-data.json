The photos are just to give you an idea of what each item can look like, but as explained in the Introduction section please don’t worry about the end product.</p>\n<p>Several of the items are for use in both this months Minibeasts theme and next months farm theme.  Keep the red, yellow and orange pipe cleaners along with the white and yellow card for the farm theme. If there aren’t any in your pack collect four plastic milk bottle tops (preferably green ones) for the hungry caterpillar\ncraft.  I have been collecting these for sometime but didn’t manage to get enough for twenty packs.  There are a number of other resources that are for the farm theme such as extra lollipop sticks and sticky eyes so just keep any that aren’t required for the Minibeasts theme ready for next month.<br>\n<strong>Bee on a stick</strong> - Draw a circle on the black card by drawing around a small cup.  Draw two circles for eyes, again on black card, using a large coin.  Then draw two smaller circles for eyes on the white paper using a small coin and wings on the transparent paper.  Cut out all of these and then cut yellow strips.  Then assemble your bee by sticking the yellow strips on the black body, wings on opposite sides and the eyes at the top with the white circles inside the black circles.  </p>\n<p><strong>Ladybird</strong> - Draw a circle on the black card and another on the red card  by drawing around a small plate.  Draw a circle on the black card by drawing around a small cup. Cut it in half, stick one piece to the top of the big black circle for the face and add two eyes.  The other piece is not needed.  Cut the red piece of card in half, these will be the wings.  Slightly overlap the point of the semi circles at one end and line them up with the large black circle.  Attach a split pin in the middle to hold the three pieces together and so the wings can move. Stick the black circles on the wings for spots.  </p>\n<p><strong>Symmetrical butterfly</strong> - Use the paint sticks to make colourful patterns on the butterfly.  Use the pipe cleaner as antennae, cut two pieces and attach on either side of the top of the butterfly.</p>\n<p><strong>Bottle top caterpillar</strong> - use the red bottle top for the head and the green bottle tops for the body.  Use the strip of card to attach them to.  You may find it easier to attach the bottle tops upside down.  If you don’t have PVA glue double sided sticky tape or folded sellotape works well.  Add eyes and cut two pieces of pipe cleaner for antennae and stick either side of the red bottle top.  </p>\n<p><strong>Paper plate snail</strong> - use the strip of card to cut a out a snails body.  Use sticky eyes and antennae and decorate with the paint sticks.  Using the paint sticks decorate  the paper plate by starting in the middle and moving the paint stick in a circle, getting wider each time.</p>\n<p><strong>Minibeast sticker scene</strong> - use the blue and green paper to make an outdoor backdrop.  You could cut a piece of green paper in half and cut slits through the top to create a grass effect and then attach it to the blue piece.  How about using the paint sticks to draw tress, sun, clouds and birds e.t.c.  Use the minibeast stickers to decorate.  Encourage your child to place the stickers in various positions on the scene.  Use the scene as a talking point to encourage your child’s speech and language skills.  </p>\n<p><strong>Minibeast fingerprint scene</strong>  - repeat the steps above for creating the minibeast backdrop.  Use the inkpad to create a range of Minibeasts and why not have a go at making your own.  Use the scene as a talking point to encourage your child’s speech and language skills.  </p>\n<p>Add one or two lollipop sticks on each piece of craft (depending on size) so that your child can use it as a puppet during the sessions.  Remove the lollipop sticks before putting the craft in your scrap book and keep them for future themes.</p>\n<p><strong>Sensory Play</strong></p>\n<p>Included in your pack is an inflatable tray.  When inflated there are a number of items that you can use together or alternate in the tray to create a minibeast habitat.  Then add the different minibeasts.  The net, scoop and tweezers can be used to collect the Minibeasts and are a great way to develop fine manipulative skills.  This activity is another ideal opportunity to encourage your child’s speech and language skills.  </p>"}},"resourceTitle":"Minibeasts Theme"}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"minibeasts"}}}
