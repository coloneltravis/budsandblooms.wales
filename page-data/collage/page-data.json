Scrap materials can be purchased from scrap stores or fabric stores and craft materials like foam shapes, pom poms and feathers e.t.c. can be bought from local shops inexpensively.  Choose a few materials for one session so that different materials can be used on another occasion.</p>\n<p>Provide your child with a sheet of paper. A large piece of paper (such as old wallpaper) is better as it does not restrict them and is also good to use if you have more than one child as it allows them to work together.</p>\n<p>Provide a range of materials so that the child can choose a few that they would like to use.</p>\n<p>Support them to spread glue over th sheet of paper and allow them to use the materials to create what theywould like to.</p>"}}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"collage"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3159585216","3504309855"]}
