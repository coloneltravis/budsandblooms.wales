I look after a 6 year old and twins of 9 months. They have all gotten something out of sessions- listening to stories and singing along to songs ( 6year old), enjoying watching their sister act out songs and play with props (twins). The resource pack that was sent was amazing the 6 year old has enjoyed making the crafts and the twins have enjoyed the sensory resources. Would highly recommend, it’s now become part of our routine on a Monday 😀 thank you.</p>"}},"feedbackAdded":"2020-08-11"}},{"node":{"contentful_id":"1JdUP82MvvAEwDp5L6DmA6","providerName":"Rebekah","feedbackMarkdown":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"html":"<p>Buds and Blooms is such a lovely group and was a great way for my son to socialise with other children as well as the residents of the home before coronavirus hit. Since then it's taken on other significance as its now online and is one of a rare few opportunities for him to be part of something close to what was normal for him before. He instantly recognised Ginny and was so excited to see her. The zoom sessions help break up long days in the house for us and the crafts give us some variety in things to do outside of the sessions as well. We play with the masks and puppet etc most days and it included some books which after reading ours countless times over😅 was much appreciated too. Thanks so much Ginny for your hard work and for being so adaptable to make it work so well online. I'd recommend anyone with young children to try a session, doesn't matter at all and there's no pressure if you run a little late or if they dip in and out a bit which makes it easier and more accessible too. I was really dubious before we started about how long the ipad would hold his attention but he actually loved it and was fine playing on and off joining in when he wanted so don't let that put you off 😊</p>"}},"feedbackAdded":"2020-06-05"}},{"node":{"contentful_id":"5sgaQMIUYLrtmUhjhtNncF","providerName":"Rebecca","feedbackMarkdown":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"html":"<p>We have joined the group since lockdown as the playgroup I run hasn’t been able to meet. My 4 year old has loved having something to do with me that isn’t her brothers google classroom! The group is very welcoming and relaxed. The resources we have been sent are a godsend as they give me crafts ready to go! Would love to meet the other group members in the future in person. Many thanks to Virginia for running such a wonderful initiative.</p>"}},"feedbackAdded":"2020-07-07"}},{"node":{"contentful_id":"6t5JmDR0OmWlRQ4blz6aUo","providerName":"Sian","feedbackMarkdown":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"html":"<p>Me and my daughter are really enjoying the online group. It's great to still be able to do something like this when we aren't able to meet in person. Ginny has adapted the session well and we have fun singing the songs and listening the story.
