Since then it's taken on other significance as its now online and is one of a rare few opportunities for him to be part of something close to what was normal for him before. He instantly recognised Ginny and was so excited to see her. The zoom sessions help break up long days in the house for us and the crafts give us some variety in things to do outside of the sessions as well. We play with the masks and puppet etc most days and it included some books which after reading ours countless times overðŸ˜… was much appreciated too. Thanks so much Ginny for your hard work and for being so adaptable to make it work so well online. I'd recommend anyone with young children to try a session, doesn't matter at all and there's no pressure if you run a little late or if they dip in and out a bit which makes it easier and more accessible too. I was really dubious before we started about how long the ipad would hold his attention but he actually loved it and was fine playing on and off joining in when he wanted so don't let that put you off ðŸ˜Š</p>"}},"feedbackAdded":"2020-06-05"}},{"node":{"contentful_id":"5sgaQMIUYLrtmUhjhtNncF","providerName":"Rebecca","feedbackMarkdown":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"html":"<p>We have joined the group since lockdown as the playgroup I run hasnâ€™t been able to meet. My 4 year old has loved having something to do with me that isnâ€™t her brothers google classroom! The group is very welcoming and relaxed. The resources we have been sent are a godsend as they give me crafts ready to go! Would love to meet the other group members in the future in person. Many thanks to Virginia for running such a wonderful initiative.</p>"}},"feedbackAdded":"2020-07-07"}},{"node":{"contentful_id":"56Bkzq78b9XLuUT81N0YHy","providerName":"Jasmine","feedbackMarkdown":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"html":"<p>My son absolutely loves attending buds and blooms!\nIts lovely to see him interacting with the residents and also seeing how happy the children make them.\nGinny puts so much effort into each group and Morel Court's staff and residents are always so welcoming.

I look after a 6 year old and twins of 9 months. They have all gotten something out of sessions- listening to stories and singing along to songs ( 6year old), enjoying watching their sister act out songs and play with props (twins). The resource pack that was sent was amazing the 6 year old has enjoyed making the crafts and the twins have enjoyed the sensory resources.
