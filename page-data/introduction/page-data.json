Everything which is supplied is safe for your child as long as they are supervised.  Buds and Blooms can therefore not be held responsible for any accidents that result from using the resources provided.</p>\n<p>The craft activities are for your and your child/ren to enjoy making together and then use alongside the rhymes at Buds and Blooms sessions.  If your child is able to help make the craft then support them to do so, don’t worry about the finished product and each item looking perfect, it’s the process that is important and children will learn so much from this.  </p>\n<p>In addition to the themed resources, you will find the following in your first pack.  Which ones you will need will depend on the current theme.  </p>\n<p><strong>Star</strong> - attach the round stick, cut the ribbon and attach and the things included to decorate.</p>\n<p><strong>Streamer</strong> - attach each ribbon to the hoop with two knots.</p>\n<p>You will also find a beanbag, scarf and beach ball in your pack.  </p>\n<p>A drawstring bag is included for you to put your beanbag, scarf, streamer and star in.</p>\n<p>I have included a scrapbook so that when you’ve finished using the craft for the sessions they can be stuck in and kept which is lovely way to look back at things you have created with your child.</p>\n<p>It would be lovely if you could send me photos of any the completed craft as and when you make something  so that I can share them on our Facebook page.  Your children don’t have to be in the photos.  </p>"}},"resourceTitle":"Introduction to Buds and Blooms resource packs"}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"introduction"}}}
