Keep adding more water until you have a runny consistency, but not too thin.  Remember to stir each time you add the water.</p>\n<p>This is a magic play material and is suitable for children and adults alike!  It can be very messy but it is easy to clean up, especially when it dries.</p>\n<p>Add small plastic toys to encourage your children to take part and it is a great way of encouraging imaginative play.</p>\n<p>The toys you use can determine what colour of food colouring you use. For example, blue could be used with ducks and sea creatures and green could be used with farm animals.</p>"}}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"gloop"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3159585216","3504309855"]}
