The photos are just to give you an idea of what each item can look like and to save you having to read through lots of instructions whilst trying to entertain your child.  As explained in the Introduction section please don’t worry about the end product.</p>\n<p>Farm animal tubes consisting of a pig, chicken, cow, horse and sheep - Start by colouring one tube brown and colour black patches on the other.  Make each strip of cardboard into a cylinder and attach the two open ends.  Use the feathers, (apologies to those who haven’t got any feathers, I couldn’t find them in time to make your packs up) pink button, sticky eyes and pipe cleaners to decorate each animal.  </p>\n<p><strong>Farmyard sticker scene</strong> - use the blue and green paper to make a farmyard backdrop.  You could cut a piece of green paper in half and cut slits through the top to create a grass effect and then attach it to half a blue piece of paper.  How about using the paint sticks to draw tress, sun, clouds and birds e.t.c.  Use the farmyard stickers to decorate.  Encourage your child to place the stickers in various positions on the scene.  Use the scene as a talking point to encourage your child’s speech and language skills.  </p>\n<p><strong>Farm fingerprint scene</strong>  - repeat the steps above for creating the farm backdrop.  Use the inkpad to create a range of farm animals and why not have a go at making your own.  Use the scene as a talking point to encourage your child’s speech and language skills.  </p>\n<p><strong>Dingle dangle scarecrow</strong> - Have a go at making a scarecrow using the surplus items that you have and feel free to add your own too.  Its best to do this activity last so you know what left over items there are.  I’ve left this activity totally open ended on purpose.  I would especially love to see a photo of your finished scarecrow.  </p>\n<h3>Sensory Play</h3>\n<p>Included in your pack is an inflatable tray.  When inflated there are a number of items that you can use together or alternate in the tray to create a farmyard.  Then add the different animals you have.  You can also add different types of cereals for the animals to eat.  This activity is another ideal opportunity to encourage your child’s speech and language skills.  </p>"}},"resourceTitle":"At The Farm Theme"}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"farmtheme"}}}
