I started these as I am passionate about intergenerational work and the benefits it brings. The groups aim to bring pre-school children, (and their school aged siblings in the holidays) their parents and residents/service users of the venues together, thus breaking down the barriers between the younger and older generations.</p>\n        <p>The benefits that the groups have brought are: enabling young children to interact with the elderly with growing confidence, the children are learning skills such as turn taking and sharing with their peers and the residents whilst enjoying a range of structured activities which will aid their holistic development, enabling parents to make new friends and share parenting experiences with each other, giving the elderly a sense of purpose, participating in the sessions energises and invigorates the elderly, it is helping to prevent loneliness and isolation as the residents enjoy coming into the communal area to socialise with the children and parents, the residents enjoy sharing anecdotes with the parents about parenting when their own children were young, the parents feel that they are contributing positively to the health and well-being of the residents, it gives the residents, parents and children something to look forward to and increases the self-esteem and self-worth of all involved.</p>\n        <p>The venues really value us attending, staff have said how much residents enjoy and benefit from the sessions. The residents tell me how they love seeing the children and watching them develop from week to week. The staff at the venues and myself discuss ways that we can develop the relationship between the younger and older generations such as summer outings, special events like a teddy bears picnic and that it would be of benefit to continue through the summer holidays to keep continuity for everyone involved. Parents really value the opportunity for their children to interact with the elderly and enjoy the inclusive nature and content of the sessions.</p>\n    </Layout>\n)\n"],"sourceRoot":""}
